Smart surveillance refers to providing security in absence of authorized person. There are various surveillance
systems such as camera, CCTV etc. Such types of surveillance systems does not provide immediate alertness in case of
intrusion. Whereas in this system the user is immediatelyalerted through SMS and he/she can check the uploaded
images or videos by accessing the cloud. The system comprisesof PIR sensor, Ethernet, relay, Raspberry Pi interface board and
camera and alarm. The PIR motion sensor will detect the intrusion by sensing the change in the temperature and sends
the signal to the Raspberry Pi board which triggers the camera to capture the images or videos. Simultaneously the sending of
a SMS and uploading of the images or videos will get start on the cloud server. This process is done by using Ethernet
connection. The lights and alarm will also get turned on. Thus the system smartly provides high level active security so the
Necessary action can be taken in a short span of time in case of an emergency. It provides security to the working area, home,
office or any important places where security is needed. User gets notification from the cloud at a time intruder comes into
that particular area.

Specifications:

1.Raspberry pi B+:
 Dual step-down (buck) power supply for 3.3V and 1.8V
 5V supply has polarity protection, 2A fuse and hot-swap protection (so you
can plug/unplug USB without resetting the board)
 New USB/Ethernet controller chip
 4 USB ports instead of 2 ports
 40 GPIO pins instead of 26. The top/first 26 pins match the original layout, 9
additional GPIO and 2 EEPROM Plate identification pins
 Composite (NTSC/PAL) video now integrated into 4-pole 3.5mm
&#39;headphone&#39; jack
 MicroSD card socket instead of full size SD
 Four mounting holes in rectangular layout
 Many connectors moved around
 Mini computer
 LINUX based OS
 Operating Frequency – 700MHz
 SD card slot
 Power Rating :800mA - 0.5W to 1W

2.Camera:
1. Omnivision 5647 CMOS image sensor in a fixed-focus module
2. 5-megapixel resolution
3.Still picture resolution 2592 x 1944
4. Image control functions-Automatic exposure control
Automatic white balance
Automatic band filter
Automatic 50/60 Hz luminance detection
Automatic black level calibration
5.Operating temperature -30° to 70°
6. 15cm ribbon cable

3. PIR sensor:

Size: Rectangular
Output: Digital pulse high (3V) when triggered (motion detected) digital low when
idle (no motion detected).
Pulse lengths are determined by resistors and capacitors on the PCB and differ
from sensor to sensor.
Sensitivity range: up to 20 feet (6 meters) 110° x 70° detection range
Power supply: 3V-9V input voltage, but 5V is ideal.
